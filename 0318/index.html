Like a small boat on the ocean<br/>
Sending big waves into motion<br/>
Like how a single word<br/>
Can make a heart open<br/>
I might only have one match<br/>
But I can make an explosion<br/>
And all those things I didn't say<br/>
Were wrecking balls inside my brain<br/>
I will scream them loud tonight<br/>
Can you hear my voice this time?<br/>
This is my fight song (hey)<br/>
Take back my life song (hey)<br/>
Prove I'm alright song (hey, ha)<br/>
My power's turned on (hey)<br/>
Starting right now, I'll be strong (hey)<br/>
I'll play my fight song (hey)<br/>
And I don't really care if nobody else believes (ha)<br/>
'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me<br/>
Losing friends and I'm chasing sleep<br/>
Everybody's worried 'bout me<br/>
In too deep, say I'm in too deep (I'm in too deep)<br/>
And it's been two years, I miss my home<br/>
But there's a fire burning in my bones<br/>
Still believe, yeah, I still believe<br/>
And all those things I didn't say<br/>
Wrecking balls inside my brain<br/>
I will scream 'em loud tonight<br/>
Can you hear my voice this time?<br/>
This is my fight song (hey)<br/>
Take back my life song (hey)<br/>
Prove I'm alright song (hey, ha)<br/>
My power's turned on (hey)<br/>
Starting right now, I'll be strong (hey)<br/>
I'll play my fight song (hey)<br/>
And I don't really care if nobody else believes (ha)<br/>
'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me<br/>
A lot of fight left in me<br/>
Like a small boat on the ocean<br/>
Sending big waves into motion<br/>
Like how a single word<br/>
Can make a heart open<br/>
I might only have one match<br/>
But I can make an explosion<br/>
This is my fight song (hey)<br/>
Take back my life song (hey)<br/>
Prove I'm alright song (hey)<br/>
My power's turned on (hey)<br/>
Starting right now, I'll be strong (I'll be strong)<br/>
I'll play my fight song (hey)<br/>
And I don't really care if nobody else believes<br/>
'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me<br/>
No, I've still got a lot of fight left in me
